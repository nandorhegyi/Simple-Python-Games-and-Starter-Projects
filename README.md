|Project|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Guessing Game|In this game the computer generates a random number between 1 and 1000 and the user takes turns trying to guess the number until they win. After each incorrect guess they are told to guess higher or lower.|
|Fizz Buzz|Fizz Buzz is a fun numbers game where you shout fizz if a number is divisible by 3 and buzz if by 5. You say fizz buzz if it is divisible by both and just say the number if by neither. Here, the user and the computer take turns until you reach 100, if you mess up you lose! 🤦‍♂️|
|Hi-Low Game|This is an updated, fully automated version of a game where the user thinks of a number and the computer takes turns guessing it. In this version the computer goes through every number in a range and guesses it in a certain amount of attempts. When finished it doesn't only show the number of attempts for each number but also indicates the number of times it was absolutely certain it guessed the correct number in the given range without being told, ie. the number was guessed using the maximum amount of attempts possible.|
