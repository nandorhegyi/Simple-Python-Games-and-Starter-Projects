# Simple-Python-Games-and-Starter-Projects
A collection of **fun** games and **useful** python tools!😃

My aim is to update this repo and add more projects as I master more skills and progress with my career.
Feel free to clone the apps and enjoy the games/tools. Additions and improvements are always welcome!! 😉


|Project|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Guessing Game|In this game the computer generates a random number between 1 and 1000 and the user takes turns trying to guess the number until they win. After each incorrect guess they are told to guess higher or lower.|
|Fizz Buzz|Fizz Buzz is a fun numbers game where you shout fizz if a number is divisible by 3 and buzz if by 5. You say fizz buzz if it is divisible by both and just say the number if by neither. Here, the user and the computer take turns until you reach 100, if you mess up you lose! 🤦‍♂️|
|Hi-Low Game|This is an updated, fully automated version of a game where the user thinks of a number and the computer takes turns guessing it. In this version the computer goes through every number in a range and guesses it in a certain amount of attempts. When finished it doesn't only show the number of attempts for each number but also indicates the number of times it was absolutely certain it guessed the correct number in the given range without being told, ie. the number was guessed using the maximum amount of attempts possible.|
|File Search|Have you ever found yourself looking at a huge directory while searching for files in a specific folder? If you have then this is for you! ☺️ Just change the name of the root directory and enter the specific phrase that you are looking for!|
|Jukebox|This is a simulation of a super simple jukebox using __tkinter__. You scroll through a number of artists, select one, look thorugh their albums, pick one, then select a song you want to hear. 🎵|
|Cave Game|This is a super simple simulation of a game where you find yourself at a specific location and can choose which way you want to go next from the available options. Here, you start on a road and have 5 options to choose from. Game accepts both numbers and words as input.|
|Blackjack|A fun simple version of the super popular blackjack game built using __tkinter__. ♠️ ♦️ You play against a dealer and your aim is to get higher than the dealer without going over 21. If you go over 21 or the dealer finishes with a higher sum you lose! You have the option to start a new game or shuffle the deck if you wish. Each game starts with seeing two of your cards and one of the dealer's. An ace can be worth 1 or 11 points whilst picture cards are worth 10 points, number cards are their face value. Have fun!!|
|Alien Invasion|An addicting, fun version of the classic alien invasion game, where aliens 👽 appear on the screen trying to destroy your spaceship. Here, you got 3 lives (🚀) and as you shoot down each fleet the next one becomes more vicious! Enjoy!! 😃  (The game was built using **Pygame**.)|
|Flappy Bird|A challenging version of the super popular flappy bird game built using **Pygame** 🐤. Have a go at it and see if you can beat my high score of 31! (The game gradually speeds up as the bird passes through the pipes).|

(Card images for blackjack game and dataset for jukebox and file search were taken from a python course on Udemy.)
